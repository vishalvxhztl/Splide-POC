## Unleash the Splide Events!

For smooth sailing with React Splide, let's understand the event handling process.

Each [splide js](https://splidejs.com/guides/events/#listening-to-events) event is at your fingertips in [react-splide](https://splidejs.com/integration/react-splide/#events). Just remember to use the on prefix and [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) the event name.

### For example

<strike>autoplay:playing</strike> -> <b>onAutoplayPlaying</b>

```js
// The first parameter is the event, and the rest of the data can be found in the documentation mentioned above.
onAutoplayPlaying={(event, rate) => {
  console.log(rate); // Ranges from 0 to 1
}}
```
